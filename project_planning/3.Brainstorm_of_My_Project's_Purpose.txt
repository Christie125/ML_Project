I want to build a linear regression model.
But, what will it actually predict?

Areas of interest:
-> social sciences/humanities
-> something related to the world around me that I actually interact with, i.e. not complicated economy things
-> coding/programming
-> music
-> sciences, e.g. chemistry, biology, physics

Areas that are hard to predict for me because I don't understand them enough:
-> music -- I mean I could technically predict tempo and bpm and that kind of thing but that's a bit boring and also I don't know a whole lot about music theory so it would it hard
-> sciences -- I don't know that much about science seeing as I'm only in Year 11 and don't know about factors that could influence a scientific piece of data. It's also not something which I want to spend hours researching right now.

Areas with available data on them:
-> social science stuff
---> education
---> population
---> income (too hard rn, see above)
---> people's habits

Since I am in school, maybe it would be a good idea for me to focus on education. Factors like attendance and exam scores are easy to predict because they are numerical and thus can be used in a linear regression context. My understanding of the field will also allow me to clean the data better and I will be able to spot obvious outliers and unusual features.

I have found a dataset on Kaggle, which includes a students:
- attendance
- sleep time
- exam difficulty
- age
- exam score

I think that I can use some of these as inputs to predict one of these.
Maybe I can use the former four to predict a student's exam score.

I have decided my idea:
I would like to build a linear regression machine learning model, which, taking in a student’s age, attendance, hours studied, hours slept, and exam difficulty, gives a predicted exam score.
