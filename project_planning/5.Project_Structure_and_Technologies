*Project Structure (Will Update as I Go)*

General Flow:
    1. User lands on browser page
    2. HTML and CSS are rendered that explains the product
    3. User clicks 'give it a go' button and inputs form data
    4. User clicks predict button
    5. Pedict button sends signal to backend
    6. Backend sends API to model to fetch prediction for given inputs
    7. API returns prediction
    8. User is redirected to the prediction page with the prediction as a query parameter
    9. Prediction is displayed
    10. The user's input data is taken: if their sleep, attendance, or time studied is low, they are shown a message to improve this to improve this under the prediction.
    11. Under the above, there is a list of useful resources for the student, e.g. pomodoro timer, study videos, Khan Acedemy
    12. Under the above, there is a retry button which restarts the cycle


Frontend details:

There will be three HTML pages:
-> the landing page
-> the input page
-> the results page

The landing page will contain:
-> a title

-> a large button that takes users to the input page

The landing page's styles (CSS) will be:
-> A playful display font for the title
-> A sans-serif main font
-> a playful academia-inspired button style
-> a light academia background
-> some sticker-like elements 
-> cursor and text animations if I have time

The input page will contain:
-> a heading -- "input sine info"
-> a form to input aforementioned data
-> a submit button which takes users to the prediction page

The input page's styles (CSS) will be:
-> A playful display font for the heading
-> A sans-serif main font
-> a playful academia-inspired button style

AI Model Details:

-> Flask will have my routes and stuff
